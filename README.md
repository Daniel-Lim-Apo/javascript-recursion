Tutorial Javascript Recursion - Examples

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, identical subproblems.

Key concepts:

Base case: The simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly, without further recursion again. It is essential to avoid infinite loops.

Recursive case: The process of breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems and calling the function recursively to solve them. This approach continues until the problem reaches the base case.
